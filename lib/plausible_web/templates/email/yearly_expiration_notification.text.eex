Time flies! This is a reminder that your annual subscription for <%= Plausible.product_name() %> will expire on <%= @next_bill_date %>.

You need to renew your subscription: <%= PlausibleWeb.Router.Helpers.billing_url(PlausibleWeb.Endpoint, :choose_plan) %> if you want to continue using Plausible to count your website stats in a privacy-friendly way.

If you don't want to continue your subscription, there's no action required. You will lose access to your dashboard on <%= @next_bill_date %> and we'll stop accepting stats on <%= @accept_traffic_until %>.
